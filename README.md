Hnefatafl is an ancient Scandinavian board game. This game currently has no easily avalible online presence, as the only readily avalible version requires an outdated plugin.

What this project seeks to do is implement an online version of this game with single- and multi-player capabilities.

The tools that will be used are still being decided, but currently HTML5, Node.js, and Socket.IO are the libraries and languages that will be included.
